<h2>Main</h2>
<p><img src="2019명함.jpg" width="100%"</p>
<p> My name is <strong>Yuyong</strong>. This is my own page to write about my life.</p>
<br>I like to sing a song, listen to music, and I love Animation in all over the world.
<p>But especailly, I like Idol anime, and I've been doing some Cosplaying since I was 14-years-old.
  I've learn to make cloth because I love Cosplaying, and I though that I want to make a web page on my own,
  so I can see and share with everyone in the world what I'd done but not in SNS.</p>
  So I want to share what I love in my life, and I hope this page will help your happy hobby life.
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">This page contains what I made, what I listen, what I do, What I want to do, my university life, and etc.
    It can be confusing a little bit, but you iust need to get what you were searching for, or get ideas from my lage.</p>
